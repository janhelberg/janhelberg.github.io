I'm Jan Helberg

Born in South Africa\
Currently living in South Africa

I'm an Experienced Quality Assurance Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry. Skilled in Databases (SQL Server, MySQL and Oracle) and cloud technologies (AWS and Azure).
In recent years, I have observed a shift in the industry toward automation and witnessed first hand the amount of time saved by automation (When done correctly). As a result, I began training to become an automation engineer and subsequently transition from a Test Analyst to an Automation Engineer.
