## Why do I feel compelled to write down my thoughts?
During the SDLC, we must distinguish between when an issue is discovered, which may affect both the cost (time and impact) and the urgency with which it must be resolved.

## Definition according to ISTQB
#### Defect/Bug
A flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail to perform its required function, e.g., an incorrect statement or data definition. A defect, if encountered during execution, may cause a failure of the component or system.

#### Failure
Deviation of the component or system from its expected delivery, service or result.

#### Error
A human action that produces an incorrect result.

## Dictionary definition
#### Defect
A shortcoming, **imperfection**, or lack.

#### Bug
A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or operation of computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

#### Failure
Failure is the state or condition of not meeting a desirable or intended objective, and may be viewed as the **opposite of success**.

#### Error
An error (from the Latin error, meaning "wandering") is an action which is inaccurate or incorrect. In some usages, an error is synonymous with a mistake.

## My opinion
#### Defect
IMHO The ISTQB Definition is correct, but I would add: Deviation from requirements/what is generally anticipated.

#### Bug
When a defect becomes visible to external stakeholders (Customers).

#### Failure
Failure occurs when a system or component fails to meet expectations. **opposite of success** There is not much more to say here.

#### Error
I agree with the ISTQB definition here, however in real world we would rarely talk about human actions, we would prefer to use this noun when talking about when a bug become visible.
