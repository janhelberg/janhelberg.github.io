## What is a Test Strategy?
A Test Strategy is a formal document that has been approved by the development team. It covered a variety of topics relating to testing.

## Why do you need a Test Strategy?
We need an agreement to "What" we will be testing\
*Note: the "How" we test is covered by the Test Plan\
A well-designed test strategy will help with:
1. Clarity on what is expected to be tested
2. Risk mitigation
3. Optimal Test coverage
4. Consistency and standardization of testing
5. Guidance for Testers
6. Measurement for success

## How to write a Test strategy?
I like to write the Test Strategy with these headings:
1. Scope and Objectives
2. Test Levels
3. Test Types
4. Entry and Exit Criteria
5. Test Environment
6. Test Data
7. Test Automation
