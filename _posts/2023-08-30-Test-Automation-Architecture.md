## What is a Test Automation Architecture?
Test Automation Architecture refers to the structured design and framework that guides how test automation is implemented within a software testing process.\
I prefer to write a formal document for reference.

## Why do you need a Test Automation Architecture?
It provides structure, consistency, and scalability to your automated testing efforts. Here's why you need a test automation architecture: \
A well-designed Test Automation Architecture will help with:
1. Efficiency
2. Consistency
3. Scalability
4. Reuse of components
5. Maintainability
6. Flexibility:
7. Separation of Concerns
8. Integration with CI/CD
9. Reporting and Analysis
10. Collaboration
11. Adaptability
12. Risk Mitigation

## How to write a Test Automation Architecture?
I like to write the Test Automation Architecture with these headings:
1. Test Automation Framework: Selenium 
2. Programming Language: Selenium
3. Version Control: Git
4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Git Actions
5. Test Environment Management: Ubuntu
6. Test Data Management: Data integrated in test scripts
7. Reporting and Analysis: Custom Reporting
8. Cross-Platform Testing: N/A, we only run on Chrome
9. Performance Testing: Build in test scripts
10. Test Execution Orchestrator: Handled by Selenium
11. Modularity and Reusability: Implement a modular structure using custom utilities and libraries
