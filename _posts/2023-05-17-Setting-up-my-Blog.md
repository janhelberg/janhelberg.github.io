## Picking theme
I decided to pick [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) as my theme

I went for using the template directly (instead of going the fork option)
From here I updated my _config.yml to include my details
I also tried to set up my own favicons, this was easy and explained in [Customize the favicon](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/customize-the-favicon/)

## Writing posts
Then it was time to write my first blog post in this format
I followed [this](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/) guide
I wrote the markdown in [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#)

Next steps is converting my offline content to this blog
