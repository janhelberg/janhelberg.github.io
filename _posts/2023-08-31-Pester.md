## What is Pester
Pester is a testing framework for PowerShell, which is a scripting and automation language.\
Pester provides a way to define tests in PowerShell scripts themselves. These tests are written using PowerShell script blocks and can cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple unit tests to complex integration tests. The framework includes features for describing the expected behaviour of your code and for asserting that certain conditions are met during testing.

## Why use Pester
Pester allows you to automate the process of testing your PowerShell code. This means you can quickly and reliably test your scripts, functions, and modules without manual intervention, helping to catch bugs and regressions early in the development process.\
Pester tests serve as documentation for the expected behaviour of your code. When you or other team members revisit the code later, the tests provide a clear understanding of how various parts of the code are supposed to work.\
Pester can be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that tests are run automatically whenever changes are pushed to the code repository. This promotes a culture of continuous testing and helps catch issues early in the development process.\
Pester's mocking capabilities allow you to isolate parts of your code for testing, even if they rely on external dependencies. This makes it easier to test specific components in isolation.

## Creating a Test Module
For my example I will start by creating a file: BasicMathFunctions.psm1\
Basic File:
```powershell
# BasicMathFunctions.psm1
function Addition {
    param(
        [int]$a,
        [int]$b
    )
    
    $a + $b
}
```

## Creating a Pester Test
Next I will create the Pester Test file: BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1\
Basic File:
```powershell
# BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1
Describe "BasicMathFunctions Module" {
    Context "Addition" {
        It "Adds two numbers correctly" {
            $result = Add-Numbers -a 1 -b 2
            $result | Should -BeExactly 3
        }
    }
}
```
Full file:
<a href="https://github.com/janhelberg/PesterTesting/blob/main/Powershell/BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1" target="_blank">BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1</a>

**Describe:** The usage of this keyword permits the grouping of tests (represented by It blocks) into groups. You can have one or multiple describes within a single file. Furthermore, you can hierarchically embed describes within one another, enhancing the structural organization of your test suite.\
**Context:** Context blocks (which can be replaced by a describe block) are used to categorize tests according to the specific aspect of the function being tested.\
**It:** This block serves to define individual test cases within your testing script. Within each "It" there should be only one test dedicated to confirming a distinct part of the code being tested.\
**Should:** Is utilized for performing an assertion that determines whether a test succeeds or fails.\

## Import the Module
Browse to the folder where you placed the module and run this command:
```powershell
Import-Module C:\Path\BasicMathFunctions.psm1
```
Replace Path with your location

## Run the Pester Test
Execute this command:
```powershell
Invoke-Pester BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1
```
Note: This assumes that you have the test in the same location as the module and are in the same directory.\
Output:\
![Pester Run Result](/assets/InvokePester.jpg)

## Running the tests in a pipeline / Create the deployment
The next step involves configuring GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). To get started, follow these instructions:
1. Create a new directory named .github/workflows within your repository.
2. Inside the newly created directory, add a file named ci.yml.
This setup will enable GitHub Actions to automate your CI/CD processes.

```powershell
name: Test PowerShell on Ubuntu
on: push

jobs:
  pester-test:
    name: Pester test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Perform a Pester test from the BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1 file
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Import-Module ./Powershell/BasicMathFunctions.psm1
          Invoke-Pester ./Powershell/BasicMathFunctions.Tests.ps1 -Passthru
```

## Confirm test run
Go to Github repositories.\
Open Repository.\
Select Actions tab.\
Select the workflow run.\
